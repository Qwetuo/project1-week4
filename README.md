# TW JS Project #1: ~Lendar by Min
## ~Lendar is an app idea that is similar to tinder, but for matching events job with the casual part-time labour market.

- As a job seeker, you sign up, tell the system the days that you are free and it will match up with events available. So everytime you go into the app, you can review any new jobs that matches your profile, if interested, simply swipe right to apply, if uninterested, swipe left and never see the post again.
